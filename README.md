# fitness-tracker

## Description

This is a basic fitness tracker that will help track the amount of weight, time, and distance of your workouts over a 7 day period. This was my first time using Mongoose and MongoDB and I felt like it was pretty intuitive. This is a basic but helpful application that I will be able to use in my day to day life.
